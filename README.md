In my Expenses Tracker Flutter app,I implemented key skills such as:
setting up an AppBar, adding modal sheets for user interactions, and managing input with TextField and TextEditingController.
I streamlined data entry by allowing new inputs and manual modal closures while using Futures for asynchronous data handling. 
Also created dropdown buttons for expense categories, designed fullscreen modals, and utilized the Dismissible widget for item removal. 
Additionally, I focused on theming with custom color schemes, incorporated dark mode for usability, and employed loops to efficiently display expense data.
